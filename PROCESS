1.SMART Data process:
readSmart2016.R(AllSMART_20161025.Rda) -> smartClean.R(smartClean.Rda) -> smartPartition.R(smart5k/smart_*.Rda)

I generate AllSMART_20161025 from MySQL(datasource.smart_Tencent), then split it into files containing 10000000 lines. 
Then read it by readSmart2016.R. 
Before that, I delete 6444987-6988079 lines from AllSMART_20161025_splitap which are wrong data.
